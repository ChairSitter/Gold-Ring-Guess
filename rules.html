        <p class="rule">Click PLAY to start a round.</p>
        <p class="rule">Each round, the 25 circles are randomly filled white, light gray, dark gray, or black. </p>
        <p class="rule">The grid will have a total value based on adding 3 values: Darkness score, In-a-Row score, and Gold Ring score.
            <br/>Your job is to calculate or guess the total grid value as close as possible within 10 seconds. <br/>
            <br/>Your Score for a round is calculated from 2 numbers: <br/>-adding the Difference between your guess and the actual grid value<br/>-subtracting a Deduction of points equal to 10% of the grid value. 
            <br/>As a reward for accuracy, an exact guess will multiply this deduction by 2. <br/><br/>Aim for the lowest score in 10 rounds!</p><br/>
        <p class="rule">Darkness score- add up all the circles by color value; darker colors are worth more points:<br/>White = 1 pt<br/>L Gray = 2 pts<br/>D Gray = 3 pts<br/>Black = 4 pts</p><br/>
        <p class="rule">In-a-Row score- 3 or more of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally score as follows:
            <br/>3-in-a-row = 9 x color value<br/>4-in-a-row = 16 x color value<br/>5-in-a-row = 25 x color value</p><br/>
        <p class="rule">Gold Ring score- each gold ring scores 10 x the color value of the circle it surrounds.
