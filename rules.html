        <p class="rule">Click PLAY to start a round.</p>
        <p class="rule">Each round, the circles are randomly filled white, light gray, dark gray, or black. </p>
        <p class="rule">The grid has a total value based on adding 3 values: Colors score, In-a-Row score, and Gold Ring score.
            <br/>Your job is to guess the total value as close as possible in 10 seconds. <br/>
            The difference is calculated each round, and a Bonus is subtracted based on dividing the value of the grid by 10, because high value grids are harder to guess. <br/>An exact guess will multiply the bonus by 2. Aim for the lowest score in 10 rounds!</p><br/>
        <p class="rule">Colors score- Add up all circles by color value:<br/>White = 1pt<br/>LGray = 2 pts<br/>D Gray = 3 pts<br/>Black = 4 pts</p><br/>
        <p class="rule">In-a-Row score- 3, 4, or 5 of the same color horizontal, vertical, or diagonal score as follows:
            <br/>3-in-a-row = 9 x color value<br/>4-in-a-row = 16 x color value<br/>5-in-a-row = 25 x color value</p><br/>
        <p class="rule">Gold Ring score- each gold ring gives a bonus:<br/>10 x color value
